* Open questions:
* Where is best to run the game so it has the desired functionalities and access requirements
* What format should I store my list of words for each chapter, each word will include the german word, the english translation, and a short sentence (clue).
* * Must be accessible on my phone and have long term memory (stores my progress)
* Deployment idea - I code in VS code on my laptop, push all new updates (whenever i add new words) to my Github repo. Whatever I use to host the programme just gets it from my Github repo, so any new changes are integrated. 
   * My progress needs to somehow be sent back to the github repo after every session, to update my learnt words.
* I can manually add lists of additional words to the script to update it - this doesn’t refresh or erase progress.
* Flash cards are organised by chapter and I can select which chapter I want to practice. I will add new chapter sections one at a time as I read them.
* Each chapter is represented by an image, I will store the image file in the directory. There are 17 chapters in total - I won’t have all the chapters ready to play immediately, so for chapters that have empty vocab lists / no image, hold a placeholder blank box in its place just with the chapter number. 
* Colour scheme should use two main colours alongside the images I load. Yellow/orange #e4ab49 and blue= #213559
* Level 1 flashcard game:
   * When I start a flash card session, I’m prompted to input how many cards I want to practice. It tells me the total number of cards as reference. It randomly selects words from the entire list based on that number.
   * At the start of each session, after saying how many cards I want to do, it also asks me if I want to practice weak words (words I haven’t got correct yet), or consolidate words I’ve learnt (selects from list of words I’ve previously got right), or a random mix.
   * As sessions are completed, it updates the list of words in that chapter section by moving any words I got correct to the ‘learnt words’ list, removing them from the main list, and any words I haven’t got right yet stay on the main list of words to learn.
   * During a session, like with quizlet I can tap on the card to reveal the english translation to check if I was right. I then mark whether I got it right or wrong.
   * During the session, I can use clues. If I’m stuck on a word, I can reveal the clue which puts the word into a short sentence so I can read it in context and infer the meaning. The clue sentence will be stored in a list/dict along with the main list of words and translations.
   * Counting how many I got right/wrong and how many left. As in the example shown, it should display how many cards remaining at the top, and as I assign whether I got each card correct or incorrect, it should also count those numbers as in the example. This isn’t recorded anywhere, the main thing is just that the word is assigned to the correct list as I get it right or wrong, but it should summarise at the end of the game how I did.
* Level 2 flashcard game:
   * The exact same as level 1, but it shows me the english word first and I have to remember the german word.
   * This level ONLY includes words from the learnt words list
   * No clue available.
   * If I get the word wrong, it gets moved back to the unlearnt pile, for completion under level 1 again.
   * If I get the word right, it gets added to a ‘strongest words’ list, for completion in level 3. Level 2 draws ‘learnt’ words from both the learnt words list and the strongest words list as one single list, but strongest words are no longer included in level 1.
* Level 3 flashcard game:
   * Uses the list of ‘clue’ sentences, but the core word in question is blanked out. The correct word is on the other side of the flashcard and can be revealed when ready, same as the other games. I only get the answer right if I remember the right word to fit the blank.
   * If I get it wrong, it goes back to the learnt words list (removed from strongest words).
