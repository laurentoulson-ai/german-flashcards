German Flashcards
=================

A small web app for studying German vocabulary from 'Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen', chapter-by-chapter. It displays chapter cards, lets you select learning levels and run short practice sessions (flashcards), and tracks progress in the browser.

Quick overview
--------------
- Chapters are JSON files in data/chapters/chapterN.json. Each chapter contains a "words" array of objects with fields: "german", "english" and "clue". Chapters can be added one at a time.
- The homepage shows all chapters and a progress summary (total words, words learned).
- Practice sessions are available per chapter with three levels (learn → consolidate → strengthen). Answers update progress saved to localStorage.

Main features
---------------
- Personalised learning - upload words from each chapter you want to learn
- Three flashcard levels:
    - Level 1: Presented with german words, you must correctly guess the translation
    - Level 2: Taking all words you previously got correct from level 1, you must now guess the german word
               when presented with the english word
    - Level 3: Master the vocab - All words previous correct words from level 2 are now put to the test in
               sentence context.
- Words automatically level up and down between flashcard levels based on gameplay
- Adjustable - Set how many cards you want to test in the game, and whether you want to test weak words or 
               learned words (level 1 only)

Files & structure
-----------------
- index.html — homepage (chapters, progress summary)
- level-select.html — choose a level for a chapter
- game.html — flashcard gameplay
- css/ — styles (style.css, game.css)
- js/ — app logic (data.js, app.js, game.js, level-select.js, storage.js)

Progress (backup & restore)
---------------------------
- Progress is stored in browser localStorage under the key germanFlashcardsProgress.
- Export via the app (Export Progress) to save a JSON backup file. Import the JSON via the app (Import Progress) to restore progress on the same or another device.
- Important: progress refers to words by numeric index. If you edit chapter JSON and insert/remove words in the middle, indices will shift and the progress mapping may break. To avoid this, append new words to the end of a chapter or export progress before making structural edits.
